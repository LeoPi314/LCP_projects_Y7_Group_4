    "Implement a rMPIPD where strategies are allowed to mutate. The goal is to simulate the effect of genetic mutations and the effect of natural selection. A parameter (gene) should encode the attidue of an individual to cooperate, such gene can mutate randomly and the corresponding phenotype should compete in the MPIPD such that the best-fitted is determined.  \n"

    "## Solution\n",
    "The most compact way to implement this using the previous results and defined elements is to implement a more complex structure which can behave differently according to a memory element. This can be done using a class to manage Mutants: a mutant should have a genome which contains the gene that allows him to mutate and determine the nature of the mutation. To simulate this, the Mutant is a guy that is allowed to use some of the previous defined strategies, each one with a defined probability that changes during the match or tournament; to do so it is always allowed to have access to nice_guy and bad_guy, and from those can create mainly_nice, mainly_bad and random. At every moment the class can be called to get a move and the evolve function can be invoked to make it change."
